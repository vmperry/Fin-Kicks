Fin Kicks Game

Welcome to the Fin Kicks Game! This is a fun and interactive game where you control a scuba diver to collect various underwater items while avoiding obstacles. 
Gain points by collecting 'good' items and lose points by hitting 'bad' obstacles. 
Reach a score of 25 to win the game, but be careful not to hit the ammunition or let your score drop to -10, or it's game over!
